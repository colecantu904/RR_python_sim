# Round Robin Python Simulation

## Notes
This project is an assignment for an assignment for CSCI 390-01: Operating Systems & Blockchains, that involves simulating processe execution using the Round Robin Scheduler Algorithim. Cool little thing, if I want to add anything more I would add a way to generate as many processes with any variance as I want, and then some way to extract statistics from differnt pararmeters of burst and arrival time variance.

This method of adding a "time_remaing" and other values to the process element was inspired by this conversation into the algorithim. I needed some way to add information to the process, and a value I could update without affecting the others.
